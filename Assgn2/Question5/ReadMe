Explanation:: Load the data using genfromtxt. Fit the data and labels into SVM(for respective models)

5.py : Has implementation of SVM using kernels:Linear,poly,rbf.



On using Linear Kernel:
	Train Error =0.0
	Test Error = 0.024000000000000022
	Number of support Vectors =[542 542]

On using RBF Kernel:
	Train Error = 0.0
	Test Error =0.5
	Number of Support Vectors = 3000,3000


On using Polynomial Kernel:
	Train Error =0.0
	Test Error =0.02100000000000002
	Number of Support Vectors = 817,938
